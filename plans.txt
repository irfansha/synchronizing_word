1. We consider arbitrary automata i.e., the transition funciton is not definition
   and use the forall variables to handle all possible transitions.
2. To define the deterministic transitions we use the clause "oneof()".
3. We only consider two letter alphabet and use two different actions movea, moveb where each of them will have 2 arguments for the pair of nodes.

The following is an example with action and initial state (for n = 3 nodes):


predicates: (current_node ?y1) (edgea ?y1 ?y2) (edgeb ?y1 ?y2)

actions:

  movea(?x1 ?x2):
  precondition: (current_node ?x1) (edgea ?y1 ?y2)
  effect: (not (current_node ?x1)) (current_node ?x2)

  moveb(?x1 ?x2):
  precondition: (current_node ?x1) (edgeb ?y1 ?y2)
  effect: (not (current_node ?x1)) (current_node ?x2)

Initial state:

  (oneof
    (current_node n0)
    (current_node n1)
    (current_node n2)
  )

  (oneof
    (edgea n0 n0)
    (edgea n0 n1)
    (edgea n0 n2)
  )

  (oneof
    (edgeb n0 n0)
    (edgeb n0 n1)
    (edgeb n0 n2)
  )

  (oneof
    (edgea n1 n0)
    (edgea n1 n1)
    (edgea n1 n2)
  )

  (oneof
    (edgeb n1 n0)
    (edgeb n1 n1)
    (edgeb n1 n2)
  )

  (oneof
    (edgea n2 n0)
    (edgea n2 n1)
    (edgea n2 n2)
  )

  (oneof
    (edgeb n2 n0)
    (edgeb n2 n1)
    (edgeb n2 n2)
  )
